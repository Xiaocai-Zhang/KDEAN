# Knowledge-Based Dual External Attention Network for Peptide Detectability Prediction
## Setup
Code was developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with Python 3.8 and TensorFlow 2.8.0. You can setup a virtual environment by running the code like this:
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
cd KDEAN-main/KDEAN
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
